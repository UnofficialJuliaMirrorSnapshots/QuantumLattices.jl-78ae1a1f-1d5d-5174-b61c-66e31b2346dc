# Unitcell Description

This is the basic idea behind our framework, i.e. we only describe how the quantum lattice system looks like in a unitcell. To achieve this goal, we divide the problem into three steps:
* STEP 1: define the unitcell of the lattice;
* STEP 2: define the local internal Hilbert spaces of the system on the unitcell;
* STEP 3: define the terms connecting local Hilbert spaces on the sites of the unitcell.
